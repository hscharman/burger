# burger

## Description
This application uses HTML and CSS on the front-end and Node.js and Express on the back-end. It also employs a MySQL database connection. To play, the users can enter the name of any burger, hit submit, and it will be added to the menu. Each user entry will also appear in the MySQL database, and disappear when the user chooses to "devour" it.
